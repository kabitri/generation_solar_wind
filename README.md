Interim report as part of RESTORE-2050

Simulation of renewable feed-in for power system studies. Created while employed in Carl von Ossietzky University during 2016.

Since the final report size was too big, it was uploaded in 7 smaller parts, with part 5 uploaded as a jpg file instead of pdf, just because of the file size issue.
